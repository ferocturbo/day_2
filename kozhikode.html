        <p class="dist-intro"> 
            Kasaragod is often described as the land of forts and gods. The place is noted
            for its ritual dance Theyyam, an art that blends dance, myth, drama, music,
            art and theatrics. A performing art popular in the northern districts of Kerala,
            Theyyam can be enjoyed in all its glory at Kasaragod.
            In Theyyam, the performer is considered as a medium between the supernatural
            and the mortal worlds. The Theyyam season gifts one with a grand visual treat
            as different Theyyams take centre stage and perform the ancient art. Listen to
            the many lores at Kasaragod, a land known for festivals, folk and visual art.
            Yakshagana is one of the popular Indian theatre forms performed in Kasaragod in
            Kerala and the South Canara districts of Karnataka. The art form is characterised
            by extravagant costumes, elaborate make-up and unique stage techniques. The
            stories are mostly based on episodes taken from epics like the Ramayana and
            the Mahabharatha.
            Yakshagana cannot be described as an exclusive folk, classical or rural art form
            since it incorporates elements of all these in its narration and performance. The
            art form involves dance, music and dialogues. Yakshagana literally translates to
            ‘the music of celestial beings,’ and the narration is accompanied by background
            music played using percussion instruments. The singers and artistes perform in
            sync with it to create this celestial musical drama.
            Kasaragod is almost synonymous with the magnificent key-hole shaped fort, the
            Bekal Fort which is a historic structure. Other forts include the Chandragiri Fort,
            Hosdurg Fort, Kumbala Fort, Povval Fort, Kundamkuzhi Fort and Bandadukka Fort.
