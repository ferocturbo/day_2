            Football and food evoke intense emotions in Malappuram. Football had its start in the
            colonial era when the British taught the people how to play the game. The craze for the
            game has not undergone any change, rather, football is more of a religion to the people.
            A range of football tournaments is held here every year. The famous Sevens Football
            Tournament is Malappuram’s contribution to the world of soccer.
            The culinary spread in Malappuram is rich, abundant, unique and seeped in spices. It is
            indeed the flavour capital and the must-go-to place for gourmets. Be it snacks or main
            course, the choices are a legion at Malappuram. Biriyani, the staple diet of the land, has

        <h3>PONNANI</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Ponnani town in Malappuram has always been an attraction for travellers
            across the world since ancient times. This port town is renowned for its scenic coastal
            landscapes. It is bordered by an estuary to the North, backwaters to the South and the
            Arabian Sea to the West. It is the land where Bharathapuzha, Kerala’s second longest
            river, merges with the Arabian Sea after a long, winding journey through Malabar.
            Ponnani’s cultural fabric has always had a strong Islamic influence, dating back to the
            arrival of the first Arab traders in the state. The Ponnani Juma Masjid built in the 15th
            century by Zainudeen Ibn Bin Ahmed, the Thrikkavu temple near the Juma Masjid, the
            Biyyam Kaayal (backwaters) and the Padinjarekkara beach (view video) are some of the
            attractions in Ponnani.

        <p>

            Nilambur town in Malapuram has a lot to tell about its teak plantations that share a bond
            with the lives of its people. Situated about 53 km from Malappuram, it is well known for
            teak plantations and tribal settlements. The oldest teak plantation in Nilambur is Conolly’s Plot (view video), which is two km from the town. The Teak Museum (view 3600
            video) near it houses around 55 types of bamboos, and an arboretum with the biggest
            teak in the world. The Museum offers new perspectives on the specialities of teak wood
            and its value.
            Nilambur is blessed with ample rainfall, waterfalls and lush green forests as it lies close
            to the Nilgiri ranges of the Western Ghats (view video). The area is surrounded by hillocks
            and is home to several tribal settlements as well.
