    <h1>KOTTAYAM</h1>
    <div class="intro">
       
        <p class="dist-intro">
            Kottayam is the hub of letters, lakes, and latex. The district has a rich literary
tradition and is the birthplace of the publishing industry in Kerala. It is here that
the first seeds of the Fourth Estate were sown. The first printing press in
Kerala, the ‘CMS Press’ was established here by Rev. Benjamin Bailey in
1821. It was here that the first college of the state ‘CMS College’ was
also started. Many of the state’s leading newspaper publications and
periodicals had its first print from Kottayam. The contribution of the
district to print media and literature earned for Kottayam the name
‘Akshara Nagari’ or the ‘land of letters’. The land is luxuriously
covered with rubber plantations, hence the sobriquet ‘land of
latex’. Kottayam made great strides in the industrial sector
with its rubber-based industries, which figure as its
backbone. Kottayam is also home to many lakes, and
this vast network of lakes form part of the majestic
Vembanad Lake. </p>

        <h3>Kumarakom</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Kumarakom umarakom (View video) is a land of
backwaters in which every eddy has
a story to share. This quaint village sitting
on a group of little islands in the serene
Vembanad Lake is only 16 km away from
Kottayam town.
For visitors who want to stay close
to Nature, there is Kumarakom Bird
Sanctuary. Spread across 14 acres on the
banks of Vembanad Lake (View video), it
is a favourite haunt of migratory birds like
the Siberian Storks, and an ideal location to
spot other birds like egrets, darters, herons,
teals, waterfowls, cuckoos and wild ducks
as well.
How to reach
Kottayam is the nearest
railway station which
is about 13 km from
Kumarakom. The nearest
airport, Cochin International
Airport Ltd. (CIAL), is about
94 km away.
In addition to an enchanting backwater cruise,
Kumarakom offers visitors opportunities to
interact closely with the local community by
encouraging them to participate in activities
like roof thatching, coir spinning and fishing.
It is no wonder that Kumarakom is Kerala’s
first Responsible Tourism destination. It
has won the prestigious UNWTO Ulysses
Award for Excellence and Innovation in
Tourism as well as the National Award for
the best tourism project. Waterscapes, the
backwater resort of the Kerala Tourism
Development Corporation (KTDC), containing
independent cottages built on stilts amidst
coconut groves, is one of the highlights of
Kumarakom.

        <h3>Illikkal Kallu</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Illikkal Kallu (View Video), or the Illikkal Stone, is a monolith, sitting
on the Illikkal Hill about 6000 ft. above sea level. Each of the three
hills has a unique shape and rises 4000 ft. or more above the
ground.
One of them resembles a mushroom and is called Kuda Kallu, or
the Umbrella Rock. Another hill has a small hunch on its side and
is hence called Koonu Kallu, or the Hunchbacked Rock. Connecting
these two hills is Narakapalam, or the Bridge of Hell, a narrow bridge
about half-a-feet-wide. Illikkal Hill is one of the highest peaks in the
Western Ghats, and it lures tourists with its enchanting beauty. A
mythical medicinal herb called Neela Koduveli, is said to grow here
and supernatural powers are attributed to its blue flowers.
