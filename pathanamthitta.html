Home to many temples, heritage villages and cultural training centres, Pathanamthitta
is also renowned for the annual ‘Vallasadya’ (view video), which is held at the Aranmula
Sree Parthasarathy Temple. This grand festive occasion continues to attract travellers

        <p>
            It is a place where one can play with the adorable giants of the forest. Konni Elephant
Training Centre, situated 11 km from Pathanamthitta is a prominent elephant training
camp in Kerala that attracts a large number of tourists throughout the year. Visitors can
feed, ride and interact with the elephants here.
Lost, abandoned or hurt baby elephants are rescued from forests and brought to the
training centre. Here they are housed in wooden cages called aanakoodu, nursed back to
health, and trained by experienced mahouts. The existing aanakoodu was built in 1942
from a wood named kambakam.

            The Rock-cut Cave temple at Pathanamthitta dates back to 8th century and is of
great archaeological significance. Situated in Kaviyoor near Thiruvalla, the temple
is now preserved as a monument by the Archaeological Department. The temple
structure bears close resemblance to the Pallava style of architecture, and the stone
engravings here are regarded as among the earliest specimens of stone sculptures
in Kerala.
